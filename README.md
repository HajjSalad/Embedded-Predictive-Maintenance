## 📈 Data Logger with Anomaly Detection
This project implements a **real-time embedded predictive maintenance system** on **STM32 microcontrollers** using **Zephyr RTOS**.  

It simulates industrial machines equipped with multiple sensors, logs sensor data in real time, and performs **on-device anomaly detection** to identify abnormal operating conditions. The system is designed to be **modular, scalable, and suitable for resource-constrained embedded environments**.

2. **Object-Oriented Machine & Sensor Modeling**   
- Uses Object-Oriented Design to model Machines and Sensors, enabling polymorphic access to different sensor types
- Implements the Factory Method Pattern to dynamically create sensors at runtime based on type identifiers
- Combines C++ core logic with C-compatible wrapper APIs, allowing seamless integration with Zephyr's C-based ecosystem

3. **Multithreaded Data Pipeline**
- Multiple worker threads perform independent tasks including sensor updates, data collection, and anomaly detection
- Threads emit structured log events to a shared message queue
- A dedicated logger thread serializes and prints all output, preventing race conditions on the terminal

4. **On-Device Anomaly Detection**
- Sensor readings are continuously compared against defined normal operating ranges
- Statistical detection logic identifies deviations indicating abnormal behavior
- Anomaly handling is event-driven, minimizing unnecessary CPU usage

### 🧶 Threading Model
The system uses 5 concurrent threads with different priorities to implement a staged data processing pipeline:   
1. Thread 1: `sensor_data_writer`  `Priority = 3`  
- Generates simulated sensor values within realistic operating ranges
- Writes values into sensor objects via the Factory Pattern interface
- Emits log events describing written values
2. Thread 2: `data_collector`  `Priority = 4`  
- Reads sensor data from sensor objects
- Writes collected data into a circular buffer for time-series analysis
- Emits log events to verify data flow correctness
3. Thread 3: `anomaly_detector`  `Priority = 5`  
- Consumes data from the circular buffer
- Performs statistical anomaly detection (range checking, threshold comparison)
- Emits log events describing detection results (normal/anomaly)
- Signal `anomaly_handler` via semaphore when an anomaly is detected
4. Thread 4: `anomaly_handler`  `Priority = 6`  
- Sleeps until signaled by `anomaly_detector`
- When activated:
  - Dumps circular buffer contents to terminal
  - Logs anomaly details with timestamp
  - Emits alert messages
5. Thread 5: `system_logger`  `Priority = 7`. 
- Sole owner of terminal output — prevents race conditions
- Consumes structured log messages from a thread-safe queue
- Prints logs in a serialized manner with thread identification tags
- Example Output:
  ```
  [Thread 1] Machine 1 - Temp: 75.3°C, Pressure: 120psi, Vibration: 1.2mm/s
  [Thread 2] Added to buffer: 75.3
  [Thread 3] Running inference... MSE: 0.023 ✅ Normal
  [Thread 3] ANOMALY DETECTED! MSE: 0.087 ⚠️
  [Thread 4] ⚠️⚠️⚠️ ANOMALY ALERT ⚠️⚠️⚠️
  [Thread 4] Buffer dump: [72.1, 73.5, 74.8, 78.2, 85.4, 90.1, 95.7]
  ```
### ⛓ Synchronization Mechanisms
| Mechanism | Purpose | Protected Resource |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Mutex** | Protect sensor object access | Thread 1 (write) vs Thread 2 (read) |
| **Mutex** | Protect circular buffer | Thread 2 (write) vs Threads 3/4 (read) |
| **Semaphore** | Signal anomaly detection | Thread 3 → Thread 4 |
| **Message Queue** | Centralized logging | All threads → Thread 5 |
### 🛠️ Machine-Sensor Configuration
